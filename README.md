Notes:
- font change - Brandon Grotesque + Work Sans. Thoughts?
- map: https://snazzymaps.com/style/42/apple-maps-esque
- naming conventions:
  - camelCase
  - parent artboards start w upper case (ie: Rec, Hosts, Activity...)
  - components (big symbols) start with the parent name (ie: hostsCard, activityList...)
  - symbols like buttons and icons use underscores (ie: btn_, ic_, tab_ ...)
  - do we have to do this for ALL sub-level naming schemes?? No, it does not matter. However if we end up using Framer it will matter but we'll worry about that later)
